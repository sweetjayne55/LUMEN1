# Deploy Guide (One-Click)

1) Push this folder to GitHub as a new repository (public is easiest).
2) Open `deploy-link.html` locally in your browser.
3) Paste your repo URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourname/vpf-app) and click **Generate & Go**.
4) Netlify opens with your personalized deploy link. Approve → it builds → you’re live.

If you prefer a static button in your README, use the snippet below after you know your repo URL:

```md
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/yourname/vpf-app)
```
